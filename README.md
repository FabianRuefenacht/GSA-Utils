# GSA-Utils
Utility functions for GSA.

## Modules
- **LQPReader.py:** Contains three functions which in sequence can parse an LQP-File (Leica Quality Protocol) into a dictionary. **Note:** Only setups from totalstations with the setup-option "Freie Stationierung" will be contained. This file is by no means an exhaustive parser for LQP files but intended to simplify reprocessing of TS-Setups.
